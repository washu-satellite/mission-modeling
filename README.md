# CubeSat Orbital Mechanics

A comprehensive mission modeling and simulation tool developed for WashU Satellites CubeSat missions. This tool helps analyze, simulate, and plan orbital trajectories and mission parameters for small satellite missions.

## Features

- Orbital trajectory calculation and visualization
- Mission lifetime prediction
- Orbital perturbation analysis
- Ground station visibility calculations
- Power generation simulation based on orbital parameters
- Thermal analysis tools
- Attitude determination and control simulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open in VS Code using the Dev Container:
   
3. Ensure the vpython library is installed (this is done automatically when the dev container is opened)

## Usage

Run the app.py file to start the simulation.

Select a mission from the dropdown menu.

Click the Start Simulation button to begin the simulation.
