# WashU Satellite Mission Modeling and Simulation Tool

A comprehensive mission modeling and simulation tool developed for WashU Satellite's CubeSat missions. This tool helps analyze, simulate, and plan orbital trajectories and mission parameters for small satellite missions.

## Features (WIP)

- Orbital trajectory calculation and visualization
- Mission lifetime prediction
- Orbital perturbation analysis
- Ground station visibility calculations
- Power generation simulation based on orbital parameters
- Thermal analysis tools
- Attitude determination and control simulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

VS Code with the Dev Container extension installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open in VS Code using the Dev Container:

3. Ensure the vpython library is installed (this is done automatically when the dev container is opened)

## Usage

1. Run the app.py file to start the simulation.

2. Select a mission from the dropdown menu.

3. Click the Start Simulation button to begin the simulation.
